Why the hell am I writing this? 

Opinions are like assholes. In the sense everyone has them. And your's should be thoroughly monitored.

This is why I'm writing this blog about AI. Its a journey that I intend to take. Its going to be exciting.
At this moment I'm an absolute beginner with a 0 mind. I think the best way to learn something is through teaching someone. 

This is my open attempt at the same. I'm going to pick up AI. 

And then teach it to the world in this blog.

*I leave you with a note to enjoy yourself.*
